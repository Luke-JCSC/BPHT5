The possibilities are endless with customization.  You will see many different use cases providing proper use of elements and providing an elegant UI.  There Are different templates, and not all the html files utilize the same appearance.  We are working on breaking up the UI points into themes for these templates, but it is a means to provide the end user with the tools needed to ignore the web design and focus on their project or documentation efforts.  \r\n\r\n### Project Progress:\r\nSee: [BPHT5 Project](https://sites.google.com/a/jcsc.biz/bpht5/)\r\nThis is not a finalized solution, but you can track our progress, contribute, DONATE, and get updates at BPHT5.jcsc.biz  \r\n\r\n### DONATE\r\nYou can help us grow, and thank us for solving your HTML woes with our templates and knowledge base by donating to jcsc.biz.
